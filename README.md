# Gif Generator
This is a gif generator that uses the GIPHY API. It loads up with a few buttons already made on certain topics, and if you click one of those buttons, it loads in 10 gifs with a rating of PG or G that are all frozen. If you click one of the gifs, it will start moving after a brief pause. If you click it again, it will return to being still. If you enter a new topic, a new button will be made that will let you generate gifs on whatever topic you've added.

## Installation

You can use Git Bash to clone the repository onto your computer by entering the following in Git Bash:
```git clone https://github.com/juniperhaven/giphy-homework.git```
After doing so, open the folder you've downloaded, right click 'index.html' and open in your browser of choice.

Alternately, the project is hosted on Git Pages at https://juniperhaven.github.io/giphy-homework/

## Usage
When the page loads, you will see a number of topic buttons you can click, as well as an 'Add Topic' button:

If you click on a topic button, the page will load 10 gifs that are frozen, with their rating ('g' or 'pg') underneath each gif:

If you want to add a topic, simply enter the topic in the form:

Once you hit the 'add topic' button, a new button will appear with your entered topic on it:
