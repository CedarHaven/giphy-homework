# Giphy-Homework
This is a gif generator that uses the GIPHY API. It loads up with a few buttons already made on certain topics, and if you click one of those buttons, it loads in 10 gifs with a rating of PG or G that are all frozen. If you click one of the gifs, it will start moving after a brief pause. If you click it again, it will return to being still. If you enter a new topic, a new button will be made that will let you generate gifs on whatever topic you've added.
